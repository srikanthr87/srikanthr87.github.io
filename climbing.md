<p style="text-align: justify">Rock Climbing is an interesting and challenging sport. Indoor or Outdoor climbing gives
you an adrenaline rush. Outdoor top rope climbing provides a whole different view of the
ground below when you reach the top. I do bouldering and top roping.</p>
### Bouldering
<p style="text-align: justify">Bouldering is performed on small rock formations or artificial rock walls, known as boulders,
without the use of ropes or harnesses but you need climbing shoes to help secure footholds and chalk to keep hands dry.
While the difficulty level ranges from V0 to anywhere around V10 and up, I am now at V4. That is me posing for a picture.</p>

### Top Roping
<p style="text-align: justify">Top rope climbing (or top roping) is in which the climber is securely attached to a rope which then passes up, through an anchor system at the top of the climb, and down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. The belayer takes in slack rope throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber were to lose their hold, they would not fall more than a short distance. A harness is needed in this type of climbing. Similar to bouldering, top roping has difficulty level ranging from 5.8 to 5.15 and up. I am trying 5.12 in this. Top roping is more kind of an endurance climbing. Yep, another picture of mine.</p>

Current goals:<br>
 # Crunch V5 in bouldering<br>
 # Reach to the top via 5.13 in top roping<br>
 # Learn lead climbing
