<p style="text-align: justify">Feel younger, live longer. It's no slogan — these are actual benefits of regular exercise. People with high levels of physical fitness 
are at lower risk of dying from a variety of causes, according to a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association..</p>
### Running
<p style="text-align: justify">“Running is nothing more than a series of arguments between the part of your brain that wants to stop and the part that wants to keep going.”
                               — Unknown<br><br>
               “Now if you are going to win any battle you have to do one thing. You have to make the mind run the body. Never let the body tell the mind what to do. The body will always give up. It is always tired in the morning, noon and night. But the body is never tired if the mind is not tired.”
                               — <b>George S Patton</b>.<br><br>
                “The will to win means nothing without the will to prepare.”

### Weights
<p style="text-align: justify">Top rope climbing (or top roping) is in which the climber is securely attached to a rope which then passes up, through an anchor system at the top of the climb, and down to a belayer at the foot of the climb. The belayer takes in slack rope throughout the climb, so that if at any point the climber were to lose their hold, they would not fall more than a short distance. A harness is needed in this type of climbing. Similar to bouldering, top roping has difficulty level ranging from 5.8 to 5.15 and up. I am trying 5.12 in this. Top roping is more kind of an endurance climbing. Yep, another picture of mine.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Running lowered the risk for mortality when a person did not exceed more than 20 miles a week, log more than five to seven miles per hour, or run more than two to five times a week, the authors reported.</p>

Current goals:<br>
 # Run for 3 miles a day<br>
 # Reach to the top 5 miles in top run<br>
